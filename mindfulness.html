                People who practice mindfulness learn to become familiar with their own ‘habits of mind’. Through
                regular practice they begin to notice how they often react rather than respond. They become more
                familiar with their body-mind connection and they learn to cultivate a kinder, more compassionate
                response to their own experience. To help them do this they may spend some time every day practising
                some mindfulness practices such as the body scan, sitting meditation, mindful movement and mindful
                eating.

                <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we
                    think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make
                    healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and
                    adolescence through adulthood.

                    Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not
                    the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness.
                    Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental,
                    and social well-being..</p>

            <div class="inner-panel">
                <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. For example,
                    depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly
                    long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of
                    chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness</p>

                <p>Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on
                    many factors. When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities,
                    their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for
                    a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health..</p>

                    <p>Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can improve your
                        physical
                        health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to
                        your
                        life. But that’s not what motivates most people to stay active.</p>

                    <hr><br>
                    <p>People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of
                        well-being.
                        They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories,
                        and
                        feel
                        more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And it’s also a powerful
                        medicine
                        for
                        many common mental health challenges.</p>
                    <hr><br>
                    <p>Research indicates that modest amounts of
                        exercise can make a real difference. No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to
                        use
                        exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems, improve your energy and

                    The relationship between our diet and our mental health is complex. However, research shows a
                    link
                    between what we eat and how we feel.

                    Eating well can help you feel better. You don’t have to make big changes to your diet, but see
                    if you
                    can try some of these tips.

                    <ul class="diet-technique-list">
                        <li>Eat regularly. This can stop your blood sugar level from dropping, which can make you
                            feel tired
                            and
                            bad-tempered.</li>

                        <li>hydrated. Even mild dehydration can affect your mood, energy level and ability to
                            concentrate.
                        </li>

                        <li>Eat the right balance of fats. Your brain needs healthy fats to keep working well.
                            They’re found
                            in
                            things such as olive oil, rapeseed oil, nuts, seeds, oily fish, avocados, milk and eggs.
                            Avoid
                            trans
                            fats – often found in processed or packaged foods – as they can be bad for your mood and
                            your
                            heart
                            health.</li>

                        <li>Look after your gut health. Your gut can reflect how you’re feeling: it can speed up or
                            slow
                            down if
                            you're stressed. Healthy food for your gut includes fruit, vegetables, beans and
                            probiotics.
                        </li>

                    <p> Spending quality time with friends or loved ones can just feel good for the soul. Ever left
                        a
                        gathering
                        with friends and felt refreshed and jovial? Time spent with those that you trust and that
                        care
                        about
                        you
                        is good for everyone. Too much time time on your own can make you feel lonely and out of
                        touch
                        so it
                        is
                        important to make an effort to spend time with others</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Social networks and online interactions may give people a false sense of connectedness. We
                        still
                        need
                        physic in-person connections for our own mental health. Schedule time with friends
                        (in-person)
                        on a
                        regular basis to avoid loneliness. It doesn’t have to be a full night out. It could be a 15
                        minute
                        walk with a neighbor or meeting up for a quick coffee.</p>

                    <p>Sleep has an important restorative function in ‘recharging’ the brain at the end of each day,
                        just
                        like we need to charge a mobile phone battery after prolonged use. Maintaining a regular
                        sleep-wake
                        cycle allows the natural rhythm of the body to be reset every day and therefore optimises
                        brain
                        functioning and can improve mental health.

                        Ongoing poor sleep can be a huge risk factor for the development of major depressive
                        disorder.
                        The
                        risk of feeling depressed and/or anxious (as well as worsening existing anxiety and
                        depression)
                        increases with the severity of insomnia, and so it is important to recognise and sort out
                        sleep
                        problems as soon as they are identified.</p>
