                    People who practice mindfulness learn to become familiar with their own ‘habits of mind’. Through
                    regular practice they begin to notice how they often react rather than respond. They become more
                    familiar with their body-mind connection and they learn to cultivate a kinder, more compassionate
                    response to their own experience. To help them do this they may spend some time every day practising
                    some mindfulness practices such as the body scan, sitting meditation, mindful movement and mindful
                    eating.

                    <p>MBCT and MBSR are ‘programmes’ that have been developed particularly in health and mental health
                        settings to teach mindfulness. They are both grounded in Buddhist traditions of mindfulness and
                        have
                        attracted a lot of clinical research but it is important to emphasise that there are many other
                        ways
                        to learn mindfulness, including participating in retreats, listening to cds and reading books on
                        mindfulness..</p>

                    <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we
                        think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make
                        healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and
                        adolescence through adulthood.

                        Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not
                        the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness.
                        Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental,
                        and social well-being..</p>

                <div class="inner-panel">
                    <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. For example,
                        depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly
                        long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of
                        chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness</p>

                <div class="inner-panel">
                    <p>Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on
                        many factors. When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities,
                        their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for
                        a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health..</p>
