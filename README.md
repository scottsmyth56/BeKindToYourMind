## Design

### Colour:

The aim of the colour scheme was to provide a "soothing" and "calm" feeling to the site and not overload the user's senses with harsh colours or elements.
The Lightblue colour choice was motivated through research and the pyschological impact colours have on a person with portraying feelings of calm and serenity.
The Secondary colours were chosen for good contrast on the lightblue primary colour.
