                <h2>What is Mindfulness? <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i></h2>

                <p class="index-para-text"> Mindfulness is the practice of ‘being fully present in the moment’.
                    It’s a different sort of awareness to the ‘automatic pilot’ that we are so often immersed
                    in – like when we’re driving or walking
                    and don’t notice the details of the journey because we’re lost in thought.
                    It can often be very difficult to be ‘in the moment’ as we can very easily become distracted by what
                    is
                    going on around us or by our own thoughts. People can ‘train’ to be more mindful in many ways such
                    as
                    through doing mindfulness courses, listening to cds, reading books or participating in mindfulness
                    retreats, although probably the most helpful way to learn is with an experienced mindfulness teacher
                </p>

                <h2>Is Mindfulness new? <i class="fa-solid fa-person-praying"></i></h2>

                <p class="index-para-text">Mindfulness has been part of Judeo Christian and Buddhist teachings for
                    centuries.
                    In 1979 Jon Kabat Zinn developed an eight-week programme called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction
                    (MBSR) to teach mindfulness to people who had chronic illness and pain. Kabat Zinn is an American
                    molecular biologist who is now Professor of Medicine Emeritus and he demonstrated through research
                    that mindfulness was very beneficial. The MBSR programme was later adapted by three psychologists,
                    Prof. Zindel Segal,
                    Prof. Mark Williams and Prof. John Teasdale as Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
                    to prevent relapse of depression.</p>

                        <p>It matters more than you think. Sleep is our body and mind's best way to recharge and
                            rejuvenate.
                            One way to get sleep better is to take a break from the stimulation of screens — TV, phones,
                            tablets or computers —
                            in the hours before bedtime. Consider reading or listening to relaxing music instead.</p>
